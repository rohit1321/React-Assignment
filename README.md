# React Assignment 
# 
Protected Routes with Token-Based Authentication
**Objective**
Create a React application with a basic authentication flow:
Users must log in to access protected routes.
Upon successful login, the app stores an access token.
Once logged in, the user cannot revisit the login page unless they log out.
If not logged in, the user cannot access protected routes (e.g., Home, Dashboard).
Include a logout feature that clears the token and redirects to the login page.
